# Mandelbrot Set
Mandelbrot set demo implemented using NumPy, Numba, DPNP, and Numba-DPEx.

## What it is
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the function 
$f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated from 
$z=0$, i.e., for which the sequence 
$f_{c}(0)$, 
$f_{c}(f_{c}(0))$, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
